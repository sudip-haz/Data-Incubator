# Data-Incubator - Challenge
Project Proposal:
As explained by UNICEF disability is complex, dynamic, multidimensional and contested. Over past few years there has been numerous studies by researchers all over the world and in the past 10 years we have noticed a drastic change in the healthcare options available. Disabled people are not handicapped but instead they are differently abled. To allow them to have similar or same abilities as an ordinary human we have characterized and adopted a few accommodations in work places or educational institutions and at homes. The personal healthcare that we are accustomed to where we may have small electronic device or a personal help provided by a human trained in that field. The current services are quite expensive and can sometimes be inadequate. But in the past few years we have seen robots who can be a companion to people who are differently able and help them accomplish daily activities. This makes is quite necessary to study the following:

-	The advances in human robot interaction 
-	The extent with which disability is increasing with age
-	The extent to which technology can help a differently abled human
-	Change in cost towards production of components

By studying the topics mentioned above we can develop a model to predict the price on what an average differently abled human will be paying for technology which would change his/her future.

With reference to the plots uploaded, They provide information regading the prevalence of disability as per the census data and the fall in cost of automation over the years.

Plot 1 _ Publish : Prevalence of disability for selected age groups 2005 and 2010 \n
Plot 2 _ Publish : Change in cost of automation with respect to robots
